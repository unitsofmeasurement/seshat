    <h1>Seshat</h1>
    <p>
      Seshat is a Java library implementing the Units of Measurement API defined by JSR-363.
      Seshat is a subset of <a href="http://sis.apache.org">Apache Spatial Information System (SIS)</a> library
      keeping only the classes required for JSR-363, with geospatial-specific functionalities omitted.
      Seshat supports parsing and formatting of unit symbols,
      together with arithmetic operations on units and on quantities.
