Seshat (from the ancient Egyptian goddess of knowledge, writing and surveying)
is an implementation of Units of Measurement API defined by JSR 363. Seshat is
a subset of [Apache Spatial Information System (SIS)](http://sis.apache.org/)
library keeping only the classes required for JSR 363, with geospatial-specific
functionalities omitted.
