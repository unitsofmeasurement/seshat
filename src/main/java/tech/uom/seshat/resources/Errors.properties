# Argument numbering convention
# -----------------------------
# This resource bundle applies the same convention than JUnit: the first programmatic parameters
# (those having lowest numbers like {0} or {1}) provide information about the context in which the
# error occurred (e.g. the parameter name or the range of valid values), while the last parameters
# (those having highest numbers) are the erroneous values that caused the error. Note that last
# programmatic parameters do not have to be last in the formatted text, since each localized message
# can reorder the parameters as they want.
